## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1. Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive redesign of the camera store's category page. The goal is to evolve from a simple product listing to a sophisticated, user-centric shopping experience. This initiative will empower customers to navigate our extensive and technical product catalog with confidence, catering to users from beginners to seasoned professionals.

### 1.2. Objectives
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Implement advanced tools and educational content to reduce user friction and decision fatigue.
- **Improve User Experience**: Create a highly intuitive, responsive, and performant interface for discovering and evaluating complex products.
- **Increase Conversion & Engagement**: Boost key performance metrics through a superior shopping experience.
- **Establish Technical Foundation**: Build a scalable, accessible, and maintainable platform for future growth.

### 1.3. Key Changes from V1
- **Faceted Navigation**: Introducing a more intelligent, dynamic, and interdependent filtering system.
- **Guided Selling**: Adding thematic filters and buying guides to assist non-expert users.
- **Enhanced Comparison**: Improving the product comparison tool for more effective analysis.
- **Defined API Contracts**: Specifying data structures to streamline backend and frontend development.

## 2. Market Research & Best Practices

### 2.1. Industry Insights (2025 E-commerce Landscape)
- **Faceted Search is Standard**: For complex catalogs, faceted search is no longer optional. It requires dynamic result counts and interdependent filters to prevent users from hitting "zero result" dead ends.
- **Guided Selling Boosts Confidence**: For high-consideration products, users respond well to "guided selling" through thematic filters (e.g., "Good for Travel"), interactive quizzes, and buying guides.
- **Information Hierarchy is Key**: Users need the ability to switch between a visual **Grid View** for browsing and a data-rich **List View** for detailed comparison.

### 2.2. Competitive Analysis (B&H Photo, Adorama)
- **Granular, Technical Filters**: Competitors offer highly specific filters for technical attributes like sensor size, lens mount, video resolution, and frame rates.
- **Availability & Deal Filters**: Filtering by "In Stock," "Used," and "Pre-Order" is a standard feature that caters to different purchasing intentions.
- **Educational Content**: Category pages are supported by buying guides and articles that help users make informed decisions.
- **Clear SEO & Navigation**: Prominent, descriptive headers and breadcrumbs are used to orient users and improve search engine ranking.

## 3. User Requirements

### 3.1. User Personas
*(Personas from V1 remain relevant)*

### 3.2. User Stories
- **As a professional photographer,** I want to filter by lens mount, sensor size, and video specifications simultaneously, so I can quickly find a camera body that fits my exact workflow.
- **As a photography enthusiast,** I want to compare the key specifications of 3-4 mirrorless cameras side-by-side, so I can make a confident decision on my upgrade.
- **As a beginner filmmaker,** I want to see cameras tagged as "Good for Vlogging" or "Cinematic Look" under $1500, so I can choose a suitable camera without needing to be a technical expert.
- **As a gift buyer,** I want to use a simple quiz or buying guide to understand the options, so I can purchase a camera that meets the recipient's needs.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Performance & Accessibility
*(Requirements from V1 remain, including WCAG 2.1 AA, Core Web Vitals, etc.)*

### 4.2. API & Data Contracts
To ensure smooth development, the frontend will consume a set of well-defined API endpoints.
- **`GET /api/category/{id}/products`**: Fetches products for a category, accepting filter parameters in the query string.
- **`GET /api/category/{id}/facets`**: Fetches available filters (facets) for a category, including dynamic result counts based on the current product selection.
- See **Appendix A.2** for detailed request/response structures.

### 4.3. State Management
- The application state (selected filters, view mode, current page) must be synchronized with the URL query string to ensure shareability and browser history integration.
- A robust client-side state management solution (e.g., Zustand, Jotai, or React Context with hooks) should be used to manage filter state and API data.

## 5. Feature Specifications

### 5.1. Faceted Navigation & Filtering System
This replaces the "Advanced Filtering System" from V1.

#### 5.1.1. Core Functionality
- **Dynamic Facets**: The list of available filter options and their product counts must update dynamically as the user applies other filters.
- **Multi-Select**: Users can select multiple options within a single facet (e.g., Brand: Sony, Canon).
- **Result Counts**: Each filter option must display the number of matching products (e.g., "Full-Frame (32)").
- **URL Synchronization**: All active filters must be serialized into the URL for bookmarking and sharing.

#### 5.1.2. Filter Types
- **Technical Filters**:
    - **Camera-Specific**: Brand, Sensor Size, Megapixels, Video Resolution (4K@60, 8K@30), Mount Type, etc.
    - **Lens-Specific**: Focal Length, Aperture, Lens Type, Mount Compatibility, Image Stabilization.
- **Thematic & Guided Filters**:
    - **Use Case**: "Good for Vlogging," "Good for Sports," "Good for Portraits." These are curated tags managed in the backend.
- **Operational Filters**:
    - **Price Range**: A slider with input fields.
    - **Availability**: "In Stock," "Pre-Order," "Used."
    - **Deals**: "On Sale."

### 5.2. Product Display System

#### 5.2.1. Layout & Views
- **Grid View**: Visual-first layout with 3-4 columns on desktop.
- **List View**: Data-first, single-column layout displaying key specs directly on the page for easier comparison.
- **View Toggle**: User's choice of view should be persisted in local storage.

#### 5.2.2. Product Card Enhancements
- **Key Specs**: Display 3-4 of the most important specifications.
- **Info Tooltips**: On desktop, show a tooltip explaining technical terms (e.g., hovering over "Sensor Size" shows a brief definition).
- **Quick View**: A modal to show more product details without leaving the category page.

### 5.3. Search & Discovery

#### 5.3.1. Guided Selling
- **Buying Guides**: The category header will include a link to a "Camera Buying Guide" article.
- **Interactive Quiz (Future Iteration)**: A simple quiz ("Find Your Perfect Camera") could be developed to guide new users to the right subcategory.

### 5.4. Product Comparison Tool
*(Functionality from V1 remains valid, with a focus on a clean side-by-side specification table in a modal.)*

---

## 6. Layout Specifications
*(Layouts from V1 are a strong foundation. The primary change is the addition of thematic filters and the list/grid view toggle.)*

### 6.1. Desktop Layout (≥768px)
```
┌─ Left Sidebar (320px) ──┐ ┌─ Main Content Area ────────────────┐
│ FILTERS                 │ │ [Sort] [View: Grid/List] [Compare] │

## 7. Implementation Plan
*(The phased plan from V1 is a good model. This version adjusts tasks to reflect new features.)*

- **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**: Project setup, layout components, basic navigation. **New Task**: Define and mock API contracts.
- **Phase 2: Core Filtering (Week 2)**: **Task**: Implement the full faceted navigation system, including dynamic result counts and URL state management.
- **Phase 3: Product Display (Week 3)**: **Task**: Build Grid/List views, product cards with tooltips, and sorting.
- **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)**: **Task**: Build comparison tool, integrate buying guides, and implement in-category search.
- **Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Week 5)**: **New Task**: Add end-to-end tests for the faceted filtering and comparison user flows.
